A simple chat bot for skype.

It only works with old skype chats (pre cloud chats). There is currently no way to make it work with newer chats :(

Features:
    Built in chat bot using ChatBot-API!
    Trivia mode! Starts a game of trivia and keeps track of score. Scores reset at the end of each game (end a game by togleing !trivia)
    Random Catfacts
    Posts youtube video and imgur titles to chat

Chat bot and trivia mode can only be on with out the other since '!' is the way to respond to both of them.

Commands:
    !ping - pings the bot
    !help - gives a list of commands
    !roll x - rolls a dice of x sides (default is 6)
    !catfact - gives a random catfact!
    !botstart - starts up the chatbot, talk to it with '!' at the start of your message
    !botend - ends the chatbot
    !trivia - toggles the trivia game, respond with '!' at the start of your answers
    

Uses Skype4Py, Beautiful Soup, and ChatbotAPI
